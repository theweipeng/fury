# Example MODULE.bazel for using Fory as an external dependency
# Copy this file to MODULE.bazel in your project root

module(
    name = "my_project",
    version = "1.0.0",
)

# Rules CC (C++ rules)
bazel_dep(name = "rules_cc", version = "0.1.1")

# Fory dependency
# Option 1: Use git_override to fetch from GitHub (recommended for external projects)
bazel_dep(name = "fory", version = "0.14.0")
git_override(
    module_name = "fory",
    remote = "https://github.com/apache/fory.git",
    commit = "main",  # Or use a specific commit hash for reproducibility
)

# Option 2: Use local_path_override for local development
# bazel_dep(name = "fory", version = "0.14.0")
# local_path_override(
#     module_name = "fory",
#     path = "/path/to/fory",
# )
