/**
 * Annotation to mark a field as an unsigned 16-bit integer.
 *
 * <p>When applied to a field of type {@code short}, {@code int}, or {@code char}, this annotation
 * indicates that the value should be serialized as an unsigned 16-bit integer (UINT16, type_id=10)
 * with a valid range of [0, 65535].
 *
 * <p>This is useful for compatibility with languages that have native unsigned integer types (e.g.,
 * Rust's u16, Go's uint16, C++'s uint16_t).
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class MyStruct {
 *   @Uint16Type
 *   int port;  // Will be serialized as unsigned 16-bit [0, 65535]
 * }
 * }</pre>
