:::warning Experimental Feature
Code generation is an **experimental** feature in Fory Go. The API and behavior may change in future releases. The reflection-based path remains the stable, recommended approach for most use cases.
:::

Fory Go provides optional ahead-of-time (AOT) code generation for performance-critical paths. This eliminates reflection overhead and provides compile-time type safety.

## Why Code Generation?

| Aspect      | Reflection-Based   | Code Generation        |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Setup       | Zero configuration | Requires `go generate` |
| Performance | Good               | Better (no reflection) |
| Type Safety | Runtime            | Compile-time           |
| Maintenance | Automatic          | Requires regeneration  |

**Use code generation when**:

- Maximum performance is required
- Compile-time type safety is important
- Hot paths are performance-critical

**Use reflection when**:

- Simple setup is preferred
- Types change frequently
- Dynamic typing is needed
- Code generation complexity is undesirable

## Installation

Install the `fory` generator binary:

```bash
go install github.com/apache/fory/go/fory/cmd/fory@latest

GO111MODULE=on go get -u github.com/apache/fory/go/fory/cmd/fory
```

Ensure `$GOBIN` or `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH`.

## Basic Usage

### Step 1: Annotate Structs

Add the `//fory:generate` comment above structs:

```go
package models

//fory:generate
type User struct {
    ID   int64  `json:"id"`
    Name string `json:"name"`
}

//fory:generate
type Order struct {
    ID       int64
    Customer string
    Total    float64
}
```

### Step 2: Add Go Generate Directive

Add a `go:generate` directive (once per file or package):

```go
//go:generate fory -file models.go
```

Or for the entire package:

```go
//go:generate fory -pkg .
```

### Step 3: Run Code Generation

```bash
go generate ./...
```

This creates `models_fory_gen.go` with generated serializers.

## Generated Code Structure

The generator creates:

### Type Snapshot

A compile-time check to detect struct changes:

```go
// Snapshot of User's underlying type at generation time
type _User_expected struct {
    ID   int64
    Name string
}

// Compile-time check: fails if User no longer matches
var _ = func(x User) { _ = _User_expected(x) }
```

### Serializer Implementation

Strongly-typed serialization methods:

```go
type User_ForyGenSerializer struct{}

func (User_ForyGenSerializer) WriteTyped(f *fory.Fory, buf *fory.ByteBuffer, v *User) error {
    buf.WriteInt64(v.ID)
    fory.WriteString(buf, v.Name)
    return nil
}

func (User_ForyGenSerializer) ReadTyped(f *fory.Fory, buf *fory.ByteBuffer, v *User) error {
    v.ID = buf.ReadInt64()
    v.Name = fory.ReadString(buf)
    return nil
}
```

### Auto-Registration

Serializers are registered in `init()`:

```go
func init() {
    fory.RegisterGenSerializer(User{}, User_ForyGenSerializer{})
}
```

## Command-Line Options

### File-Based Generation

Generate for a specific file:

```bash
fory -file models.go
```

### Package-Based Generation

Generate for a package:

```bash
fory -pkg ./models
```

### Explicit Types (Legacy)

Specify types explicitly:

```bash
fory -pkg ./models -type "User,Order"
```

### Force Regeneration

Force regeneration even if up-to-date:

```bash
fory --force -file models.go
```

## When to Regenerate

Regenerate when any of these change:

- Field additions, removals, or renames
- Field type changes
- Struct tag changes
- New structs with `//fory:generate`

### Automatic Detection

Fory includes a compile-time guard:

```go
// If struct changed, this fails to compile
var _ = func(x User) { _ = _User_expected(x) }
```

If you forget to regenerate, the build fails with a clear message.

### Auto-Retry

When invoked via `go generate`, the generator detects stale code and retries:

1. Detects compile error from guard
2. Removes stale generated file
3. Regenerates fresh code

## Supported Types

Code generation supports:

- All primitive types (`bool`, `int*`, `uint*`, `float*`, `string`)
- Slices of primitives and structs
- Maps with supported key/value types
- Nested structs (must also be generated)
- Pointers to structs

### Nested Structs

All nested structs must also have `//fory:generate`:

```go
//fory:generate
type Address struct {
    City    string
    Country string
}

//fory:generate
type Person struct {
    Name    string
    Address Address  // Address must also be generated
}
```

## CI/CD Integration

### Check In Generated Code

**Recommended for libraries**:

```bash
go generate ./...
git add *_fory_gen.go
git commit -m "Regenerate Fory serializers"
```

**Pros**: Consumers can build without generator; reproducible builds
**Cons**: Larger diffs; must remember to regenerate

### Generate in Pipeline

**Recommended for applications**:

```yaml
steps:
  - run: go install github.com/apache/fory/go/fory/cmd/fory@latest
  - run: go generate ./...
  - run: go build ./...
```

## Usage with Generated Code

Generated code integrates transparently:

```go
f := fory.New()

// Fory automatically uses generated serializer if available
user := &User{ID: 1, Name: "Alice"}
data, _ := f.Serialize(user)

var result User
f.Deserialize(data, &result)
```

No code changes needed - registration happens in `init()`.

## Mixing Generated and Non-Generated

You can mix approaches:

```go
//fory:generate
type HotPathStruct struct {
    // Performance-critical, use codegen
}

type ColdPathStruct struct {
    // Not annotated, uses reflection
}
```

## Limitations

### Experimental Status

- API may change
- Not all edge cases tested
- May have undiscovered bugs

### Not Supported

- Interface fields (dynamic types)
- Recursive types without pointers
- Private (unexported) fields
- Custom serializers

### Reflection Fallback

If codegen fails, Fory falls back to reflection:

```go
// If User_ForyGenSerializer not found, uses reflection
f.Serialize(&User{})
```

## Troubleshooting

### "fory: command not found"

Ensure the binary is in PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

### Compile Error After Struct Change

Regenerate:

```bash
go generate ./...
```

Or force:

```bash
fory --force -file yourfile.go
```

### Generated Code Out of Sync

The compile-time guard catches this:

```
cannot use x (variable of type User) as type _User_expected in argument
```

Run `go generate` to fix.

## FAQ

### Is codegen required?

No. Reflection-based serialization works without code generation.

### Does generated code work across Go versions?

Yes. Generated code is plain Go with no version-specific features.

### Can I mix generated and non-generated types?

Yes. Fory automatically uses generated serializers when available.

### How do I update generated code?

Run `go generate ./...` after struct changes.

### Should I commit generated files?

For libraries: yes. For applications: either works.
