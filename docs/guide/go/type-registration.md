Type registration tells Fory how to identify and serialize your custom types. Registration is required for struct, enum, and extension types.

## Why Register Types?

1. **Type Identification**: Fory needs to identify the actual type during deserialization
2. **Polymorphism**: When deserializing interface types, Fory must know which concrete type to create
3. **Cross-Language Compatibility**: Other languages need to recognize and deserialize your types

## Struct Registration

### Register by ID

Register a struct with a numeric type ID for compact serialization:

```go
type User struct {
    ID   int64
    Name string
}

f := fory.New()
err := f.RegisterStruct(User{}, 1)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

**ID Guidelines**:

- IDs must be unique within your application
- IDs must be consistent across all languages for cross-language serialization
- Use the same ID for the same type in serializer and deserializer

### Register by Name

Register a struct with a type name string. This is more flexible but has higher serialization cost:

```go
f := fory.New()
err := f.RegisterNamedStruct(User{}, "example.User")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

**Name Guidelines**:

- Use fully-qualified names following `namespace.TypeName` convention
- Names must be unique and consistent across all languages
- Names are case-sensitive

## Enum Registration

Go doesn't have native enums, but you can register integer types as enums:

### Register by ID

```go
type Status int32

const (
    StatusPending  Status = 0
    StatusActive   Status = 1
    StatusComplete Status = 2
)

f := fory.New()
err := f.RegisterEnum(Status(0), 1)
```

### Register by Name

```go
err := f.RegisterNamedEnum(Status(0), "example.Status")
```

## Extension Types

For types requiring custom serialization logic, register as extension types with a custom serializer:

```go
f := fory.New()

// Register by ID
err := f.RegisterExtension(CustomType{}, 1, &CustomSerializer{})

// Or register by name
err = f.RegisterNamedExtension(CustomType{}, "example.Custom", &CustomSerializer{})
```

See [Custom Serializers](custom-serializers.md) for details on implementing the `ExtensionSerializer` interface.

## Registration Scope

Type registration is per-Fory-instance:

```go
f1 := fory.New()
f2 := fory.New()

// Types registered on f1 are NOT available on f2
f1.RegisterStruct(User{}, 1)

// f2 cannot deserialize User unless also registered
f2.RegisterStruct(User{}, 1)
```

## Registration Timing

Register types after creating a Fory instance and before any serialize/deserialize calls:

```go
f := fory.New()

// Register before use
f.RegisterStruct(User{}, 1)
f.RegisterStruct(Order{}, 2)

// Now serialize/deserialize
data, _ := f.Serialize(&User{ID: 1, Name: "Alice"})
```

## Nested Type Registration

Register all struct types in the object graph, including nested types:

```go
type Address struct {
    City    string
    Country string
}

type Person struct {
    Name    string
    Address Address
}

f := fory.New()

// Register ALL struct types used in the object graph
f.RegisterStruct(Address{}, 1)
f.RegisterStruct(Person{}, 2)
```

## Cross-Language Registration

For cross-language serialization, types must be registered consistently across all languages.

### Using IDs

All languages use the same numeric ID:

**Go**:

```go
f.RegisterStruct(User{}, 1)
```

**Java**:

```java
fory.register(User.class, 1);
```

**Python**:

```python
fory.register(User, type_id=1)
```

### Using Names

All languages use the same type name:

**Go**:

```go
f.RegisterNamedStruct(User{}, "example.User")
```

**Java**:

```java
fory.register(User.class, "example.User");
```

**Python**:

```python
fory.register(User, typename="example.User")
```

**Rust**:

```rust
#[derive(Fory)]
struct User {
    id: i64,
    name: String,
}

let mut fory = Fory::default();
fory.register_by_name::<User>("example.User")?;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Register early**: Register all types at application startup before any serialization
2. **Be consistent**: Use the same ID or name across all languages and all instances
3. **Register all types**: Include nested struct types, not just top-level types
4. **Prefer IDs for performance**: Numeric IDs have lower serialization overhead than names
5. **Use names for flexibility**: Names are easier to manage and less prone to conflicts

## Common Errors

### Unregistered Type

```
error: unknown type encountered
```

**Solution**: Register the type before serialization/deserialization.

### ID/Name Mismatch

Data serialized with one ID or name cannot be deserialized if registered with a different ID or name.

**Solution**: Use consistent IDs or names across serializer and deserializer.

### Duplicate Registration

Two types registered with the same ID will conflict.

**Solution**: Ensure unique IDs for each type.
