This page covers type registration methods in Apache Fory™ Rust.

## Register by ID

Register types with a numeric ID for fast, compact serialization:

```rust
use fory::Fory;
use fory::ForyObject;

#[derive(ForyObject)]
struct User {
    name: String,
    age: i32,
}

let mut fory = Fory::default();
fory.register::<User>(1)?;

let user = User {
    name: "Alice".to_string(),
    age: 30,
};

let bytes = fory.serialize(&user)?;
let decoded: User = fory.deserialize(&bytes)?;
```

## Register by Namespace

For cross-language compatibility, register with namespace and type name:

```rust
let mut fory = Fory::default()
    .compatible(true)
    .xlang(true);

// Register with namespace-based naming
fory.register_by_namespace::<MyStruct>("com.example", "MyStruct");
```

## Register Custom Serializer

For types that need custom serialization logic:

```rust
let mut fory = Fory::default();
fory.register_serializer::<CustomType>(100);
```

## Registration Order

When using ID-based registration without explicit IDs, the registration order matters. Ensure consistent registration order between serialization and deserialization:

```rust
// Serializer side
let mut fory = Fory::default();
fory.register::<TypeA>(1)?;
fory.register::<TypeB>(2)?;
fory.register::<TypeC>(3)?;

// Deserializer side - MUST use same order
let mut fory = Fory::default();
fory.register::<TypeA>(1)?;
fory.register::<TypeB>(2)?;
fory.register::<TypeC>(3)?;
```

## Thread-Safe Registration

Perform all registrations before spawning threads:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

let mut fory = Fory::default();
fory.register::<User>(1)?;
fory.register::<Order>(2)?;

// Now share across threads
let fory = Arc::new(fory);

let handles: Vec<_> = (0..4)
    .map(|_| {
        let shared = Arc::clone(&fory);
        thread::spawn(move || {
            // Use fory for serialization
        })
    })
    .collect();
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use consistent IDs**: Same type ID across all languages for cross-language compatibility
2. **Register before threading**: Complete all registrations before spawning threads
3. **Use namespace for xlang**: Makes type names consistent across languages
4. **Explicit IDs for stability**: Avoid auto-generated IDs in production
