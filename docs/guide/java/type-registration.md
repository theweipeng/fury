This page covers class registration mechanisms and security configurations.

## Class Registration

`ForyBuilder#requireClassRegistration` can be used to disable class registration. This will allow deserializing objects of unknown types, which is more flexible but **may be insecure if the classes contain malicious code**.

**Do not disable class registration unless you can ensure your environment is secure**. Malicious code in `init/equals/hashCode` can be executed when deserializing unknown/untrusted types when this option is disabled.

Class registration can not only reduce security risks, but also avoid classname serialization cost.

### Register by ID

You can register class with API `Fory#register`:

```java
Fory fory = xxx;
fory.register(SomeClass.class);
fory.register(SomeClass1.class, 1);
```

Note that class registration order is important. Serialization and deserialization peers should have the same registration order.

### Register by Name

Register class by ID will have better performance and smaller space overhead. But in some cases, management for a bunch of type IDs is complex. In such cases, registering class by name using API `register(Class<?> cls, String namespace, String typeName)` is recommended:

```java
fory.register(Foo.class, "demo", "Foo");
```

If there are no duplicate names for types, `namespace` can be left as empty to reduce serialized size.

**Do not use this API to register class since it will increase serialized size a lot compared to registering class by ID.**

## Security Configuration

### Class Checker

If you invoke `ForyBuilder#requireClassRegistration(false)` to disable class registration check, you can set `org.apache.fory.resolver.ClassChecker` by `ClassResolver#setClassChecker` to control which classes are allowed for serialization.

For example, you can allow classes started with `org.example.*`:

```java
Fory fory = xxx;
fory.getClassResolver().setClassChecker(
  (classResolver, className) -> className.startsWith("org.example."));
```

### AllowListChecker

Fory provides a `org.apache.fory.resolver.AllowListChecker` which is an allowed/disallowed list based checker to simplify the customization of class check mechanism:

```java
AllowListChecker checker = new AllowListChecker(AllowListChecker.CheckLevel.STRICT);
ThreadSafeFory fory = new ThreadLocalFory(classLoader -> {
  Fory f = Fory.builder().requireClassRegistration(true).withClassLoader(classLoader).build();
  f.getClassResolver().setClassChecker(checker);
  checker.addListener(f.getClassResolver());
  return f;
});
checker.allowClass("org.example.*");
```

You can use this checker or implement a more sophisticated checker by yourself.

## Limit Max Deserialization Depth

Fory provides `ForyBuilder#withMaxDepth` to limit max deserialization depth. The default max depth is 50.

If max depth is reached, Fory will throw `ForyException`. This can be used to prevent malicious data from causing stack overflow or other issues.

```java
Fory fory = Fory.builder()
  .withLanguage(Language.JAVA)
  .withMaxDepth(100)  // Set custom max depth
  .build();
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always enable class registration in production**: Use `requireClassRegistration(true)`
2. **Use ID-based registration for performance**: Numeric IDs are faster than string names
3. **Maintain consistent registration order**: Same order on both serialization and deserialization sides
4. **Set appropriate max depth**: Prevent stack overflow attacks
5. **Use AllowListChecker for fine-grained control**: When you need flexible class filtering
