Apache Fory™ xlang (cross-language) serialization enables seamless data exchange between different programming languages. Serialize data in one language and deserialize it in another—without IDL definitions, schema compilation, or manual data conversion.

## Features

- **No IDL Required**: Serialize any object automatically without Protocol Buffers, Thrift, or other IDL definitions
- **Multi-Language Support**: Java, Python, C++, Go, Rust, JavaScript all interoperate seamlessly
- **Reference Support**: Shared and circular references work across language boundaries
- **Schema Evolution**: Forward/backward compatibility when class definitions change
- **Zero-Copy**: Out-of-band serialization for large binary data
- **High Performance**: JIT compilation and optimized binary protocol

## Supported Languages

| Language   | Status | Package                          |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| Java       | ✅     | `org.apache.fory:fory-core`      |
| Python     | ✅     | `pyfory`                         |
| C++        | ✅     | Bazel/CMake build                |
| Go         | ✅     | `github.com/apache/fory/go/fory` |
| Rust       | ✅     | `fory` crate                     |
| JavaScript | ✅     | `@apache-fory/fory`              |

## When to Use Xlang Mode

**Use xlang mode when:**

- Building multi-language microservices
- Creating polyglot data pipelines
- Sharing data between frontend (JavaScript) and backend (Java/Python/Go)

**Use language-native mode when:**

- All serialization/deserialization happens in the same language
- Maximum performance is required (native mode is faster)
- You need language-specific features (Python pickle compatibility, Java serialization hooks)

## Quick Example

### Java (Producer)

```java
import org.apache.fory.*;
import org.apache.fory.config.*;

public class Person {
    public String name;
    public int age;
}

Fory fory = Fory.builder()
    .withLanguage(Language.XLANG)
    .build();
fory.register(Person.class, "example.Person");

Person person = new Person();
person.name = "Alice";
person.age = 30;
byte[] bytes = fory.serialize(person);
// Send bytes to Python, Go, Rust, etc.
```

### Python (Consumer)

```python
import pyfory
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: pyfory.Int32Type

fory = pyfory.Fory()
fory.register_type(Person, typename="example.Person")

# Receive bytes from Java
person = fory.deserialize(bytes_from_java)
print(f"{person.name}, {person.age}")  # Alice, 30
```
